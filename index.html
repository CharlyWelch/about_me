                Hello! Thanks for playing my little game. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Charly. I like to spend my time adventuring outdoors, hiking, camping, and exploring the Pacific Northwest. Science is my jam, and I love making things for the people I care about. Some of my favorite hobbies are wooburning and carving, wool felting, and painting with various media (including blood). I'm mama bear to the most <em>amazing</em> seven year old, Oliver.  I <strong>LOVE</strong> cooking and eating with my family and community.

                I've done a good amount of traveling here in the US, mostly by car or bus or train, but have never left the continent. I did visit Toronto once, but that was in a different age, when you could drive across the border   with just your state ID! Some day, I'll travel the world with my kiddo. I want to see how life has evolved differently on the other sides of the planet.
