            Hello! Thanks for playing my little game. Now you know a few things about me. Let's review, and maybe add a couple details. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm an only child, and I was raised by a single queer mom in Ohio. Now I'm a single queer mom, too, with the most <em>amazing</em> seven year old named Oliver. I prefer to spend my time making things for the people I care about. Some favorites are wood burning, wool felting, painting with various media including blood, and carving. I also <strong>LOVE</strong> cooking and eating. Southern U.S. food, Thai food, Midwestern comfort foods, Japanese cuisine, Italian dishes, vegetarian, vegan, meat on meat on meat... let's eat it all!  
            </p>

            <p>
                I've done a good amount of traveling here in the US, mostly by car or bus or train, but have never left the continent. I did go to Toronto to visit friends once, but that was in a different age when you could drive across the border with just your state ID! Some day, I hope to travel the world with my kiddo so he can have a broader scope of experience than I've been able to.
